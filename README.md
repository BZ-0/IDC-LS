# 👑 Intendant LS0 👑

## 🎲 My first and biggest 🐱 Pet-Project 🐱 ever... 🎲

> I took a big risk when I decided to take such a step and project, I spent so much effort and nerves on it, already enough for 100$ reparations or compensation or reimbursement.

# 🧩 Conception and Description 🧩

## 🤖 Generated by AI (Chad-GPT) 🤖

IDC-LS, a core component of the **Intendant OS** family, embarks on a pioneering journey to redefine the essence of design and functionality within the realm of operating systems and user interfaces. Inspired by the evocative principles of **Material Design 3 (Material You)**, IDC-LS integrates a dynamic and personalized approach to design, allowing for a deeply customizable experience that resonates with the user's style and preferences.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy 🎨

At the heart of IDC-LS lies a commitment to a seamless, fluid, and adaptable design ethos. Drawing inspiration from an array of influential design systems, including **Fluent Design, Xiaomi/MIUI/HyperOS**, and others, IDC-LS harmonizes these influences into a unique, coherent visual language. Key to this endeavor is the implementation of light and dark themes, enabling users to choose the aesthetic that best suits their mood or needs, while also prioritizing eye comfort and accessibility.

The design further explores the possibilities of HDR and AMOLED displays, with a focus on delivering vivid, lifelike colors and deep contrasts that make every interaction a delight. To achieve this, the primary color model currently employed is **oklch**, with plans to explore and incorporate more advanced color models to enhance visual fidelity and user experience.

## 🏛️ Technical Architecture 🏛️

IDC-LS is crafted with a modular and asynchronous model at its core, which redefines how the DOM operates by emphasizing dynamic interactions over static engagements. Event handling is sophisticatedly designed to support various implementation strategies, such as binding to specific selector representatives, employing delegation, or targeting directly, thus offering flexibility and efficiency in response to user actions.

This architecture lays the foundation for the development of a desktop/launcher/environment envisaged as a Web application or Progressive Web App (PWA), signifying IDC-LS's commitment to creating an environment that is inherently adaptable and responsive across different device categories—mobile phones, tablets, terminals, and to a lesser extent, desktops and laptops.

## 📱 Platform and Development Environment 📱

IDC-LS is primarily developed and tested on **Chrome Canary** or **Edge Canary**, leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities enabled by their experimental features. While the framework includes certain fallback mechanisms, these are not the majority, pointing to a forward-looking, modern web technologies-driven approach.

The development stack eschews conventional frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and even jQuery, opting instead for innovative tools such as `pug` for templating, `scss` for styling, and an embrace of web components to architect a clean, efficient, and scalable system.

## 🗄️ Build and Server Architecture 🗄️

In pursuit of an optimized and efficient development workflow, IDC-LS harnesses the power of **Webpack** for project bundling. This strategic choice enables a streamlined build process, facilitating the transformation and packaging of assets, modules, and libraries into a cohesive, deployment-ready structure. Webpack's versatile plugin system and loader support empower IDC-LS to efficiently manage dependencies and static assets, ensuring a smooth development experience and a robust production build.

Complementing the build process, **Fastify** has been selected as the server framework of choice for its high performance and low overhead characteristics. Fastify's emphasis on speed and its rich ecosystem of plugins make it an ideal companion for developing lightweight and fast server-side applications. Although IDC-LS is currently designed to operate primarily in an offline setting, Fastify lays the groundwork for potential future expansions where server-side rendering, API interactions, or other server-dependent features might be explored.

This dual approach, combining Webpack's comprehensive build capabilities with Fastify's efficient server management, underpins IDC-LS's dedication to leveraging modern technologies to enhance development experience and end-user interaction. It signifies a foundational commitment to not only embracing but also mastering contemporary tools that define and drive the future of web application development.

## 🛣️ Roadmap and Vision 🛣️

The development of IDC-LS is a solo venture, driven by a blend of passion, creativity, and the desire to fill leisure time with meaningful engagement. The projected minimal viable product (MVP) is earmarked for release by 2025, demonstrating a commitment to thoughtful, incremental development. This journey is not just about building an OS or a UI; it's about crafting an experience, a narrative that will be a testament to what one can achieve with vision and perseverance.

IDC-LS is more than a project; it's an idea, an exploration, aimed at the future of user interfaces and interactions. This endeavor is chronicled as a special portfolio, each line of code, each design decision, reflecting a step towards redefining how we engage with digital environments.
